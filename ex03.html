<!--Fix bad ARIA practices
Ok, you've just started a new role. Great! Unfortunately, the previous employee had just heard about ARIA and before he left, decided to add the kitchen sink to every element he could find on the last bit of work he completed. It's your job to fix the code full of confusing, incorrect and unnecessary roles, landmarks and states, and simplify the code.

a. Have a look at the html and find each bad practice. There are five rules of ARIA, you need to find which rule was broken and describe how the rule was broken. Do this in articles below the fixed code.

b. fix the code. Remove the invalid and incorrect ARIA code so that the document is using the correct landmarks where needed and doesn't have them where it isn't needed

c. Removing the landmarks is definitely not going to fully correct this document. Ensure that the correct semantic tags are being used to correctly identify the types of content. Ensure that the styling remains consistent, do not break the layout when you fix the code-->

                </h1>
                <p>1, Use Semantic HTML5 in Favour of ARIA.</p>
                <p>2, Do not alter the Meaning of Semantic Elements with ARIA Roles.</p>
                <p>3, ARIA Elements must be Accessible by all Mediums.</p>
                <p>4, Appropriate Roles for Visible Focusable Elements.</p>
                <p>5, Elements must have an Accessible Name.</p>

                <p>Faults found include aria roles where not needed (due to semantic elements present). Role meanings changed (article to note). Aria roles within CSS. Contrast issues on help button (required for AA rating minimum). </p>
